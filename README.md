# Questions
<em>Questions</em> (June 2016) is an anti-search engine coded in the spirit of philosophical inquiry. The engine saves questions asked to it and provides no search results or 'answers' to them (queries produce more questions). Questions is a response to the automated, spoon-fed, instant gratification of contemporary search engines. The thought (urge) is to produce a space where the conclusive shivs of machinic intelligence are not perpetually upgrading the illusion of 'their' (and that of their recursive handlers) epistemic authority.

Does mere diffuse technocratic control of secretive technologies play into eugenicist delusions of grandeur in a variety of ways that usually go unsung/unacknowledged/unnoticed?

Is eugenics ever an expression of gang stalking and vice versa?

Does advanced classism in contemporary capitalism possess built in eugenicist tendencies that 'automatically' out-perform the heavy-handedness of competing neototalitarian Statist forms?

Is it true that 99.9% of dick baggers are inexorable autocucks? (Hint: the answer is <em>yes</em>!)

When will eugenics become atavistic?

Has eugenics not become atavistic?

Is "The 33D Invader" a contemporary eugenicist comedy?

To what extent does eugenics remain embedded in contemporary manifestations of biopower as thresholds of potential, risk, unforseen consequences (etc.)?

To what extent are contemporary eugenicists hiding behind euphemism and silence?

Are some people merely 'born into Hollywood' (or wherever else) as indentured slaves at the level of cloning and genetic harvesting?
